# Feedback 

1) Sabbir - The layout of the website is simple and easy to understand. The content on the website is helpful and gives a good picture on how Morgan is. To improve the website I suggest you add more colours to make it look more appealing towards the eye.

- Response to feedback - Thank you for the feedback I will defiantly look into 
 changing the colours, I wanted to keep the website clean to look at but still easy to navigate.

# Reasoning

I wanted the look of the webpage to be simple, clean but effective. I did not want to overload the viewer with information, thats why I broke it into tabs within the navigation bar. The first page was always going to be the "About Me" page it was to introduce the viewier to me as easily as possible with hobbies, skill and a small introduction  to school/college. I have an "Aside" section which brings up a side view to show one of my most "Fond Memories". 

The "Education" tab is where the viewer will find College and GCSE results, and more information on my School experiences. there is also three images attached to a bulleted list show my former secondary schools logos.

The "My Work" tab is where viewers can see examples of my work with description underneath, I used cards from Bootstrap too pull this off as well as image adjusting via Windows Photos.



# Changes

  - Originally the "Education" and the "About Me" tab where combined, I changed this because I looked too crammed together and it look messy and you where getting to much information at once. Also the "Hobbies" section was longer than the "Skills", so I changed it so " Skills" was longer as it is more important.

  - In "My Work" before images where added there were iframe's so te viewers could interact with the websites I had previously created. I stayed like this for ages until it randomly broke the website causing everything to break and resize itself bigger than it was meant to be, I checked to see if I closed the iframe off so I had no choice but to remove it.
