<!--"About Me"-->

<h1 class="text-decoration-underline">About Me</h1>

<br>

<p>Hello, my name is Morgan Plant I am 17 years old I grew up in London, England. Throughout my life I learnt many skills and many lessons. 
  I am currently at The College Of West Anglia studying an IT Level 2 Diploma. We have been learning how to code through HTML, CSS, Bootstrap & Javascript. 
  I have been developing websites as well as my skills since September 2020. I am partially confident with my skills, but would need to develop them further for any type of future in IT</p>

<br>

<!--"Skills"-->

<h2> Skills </h2>

<p> I am a good team worker when required but I prefer to work alone, I am considerate of other people’s views and perspectives. 
I am a quick-paced worker but I try and do it as efficiently as possible without making too many mistakes, I'm good at problem-solving, 
I'll try and find a way to solve the problem to the best of my ability? </p>

<li> Hard worker (I am willing to put in the effort to pass the course/subject, for GCSE English I studied Romeo & Juliet 4 times to know the story to answers my questions in my exams.) </li>

<li>I am good at problem solving. I can try and find a way to get through any task/problem (For my GCSE Maths in the middle of an exam I forgot how to do an equation,
   so to get through it I tried many methods, with many different ways until eventually I worked out the answers</li>

<li>I can follow instructions well. (I listen to the teacher so I can learn how to perform the task given.)</li>

<li>Good team-worker (I work with my classmates every day in my IT course exchanging skills and tips)</li>

<li>Excellent organiser (I like a structured approach to work, 
  for example before every exam/lesson I would set my equipment out in the same way every time so I could easily get it without looking up to find it) </li>

<br>

<p>I consider my skills to be useful in the workplace</p>


<br>

 <!--"Work Related"-->

<h2>Work Related</h2>

<li>In year 10 I did work experience in my secondary school, I was a librarians assistant in the school library, it was useful as it gave my organization and planning skills,
   as well as communication skills.  </li>
<li> In my college I also have done virtual work experience, I was doing an Unreal Engine™ course by Unreal Studios™. I learned the history of the game engine and what it’s used for in 2021,
like in virtual tv & film production, game design and texturing, architecture and the future of the engine. </li>

<br>

<!--"Hobbies"-->

<h2>Hobbies</h2>

<br>

<p>The hobbies I like are quite varied, my one of my longest hobbies is gaming, I like to pick up a controller and explore a different world. 
  Another Hobby is reading, it was only recently I decided to order my first book, Star Wars™: The High Republic: Light of The Jedi.
  It’s the first book I have picked up in years, and I enjoyed it. The sci-fi battles, the spectacular story and the connection between the characters. 
  I have already pre-ordered the sequel. </p>

<P>I watched this trailer live as it aired at E3 2018 (Electronic Games Convention) I freaked out as this was the first Story-Driven, Open-World, RPG Star Wars game in 9 Years. 
  The Game surpassed my expectations, Respawn Entertainment (Developers) did an outstanding job and with the free DLC they added the game the game got better, 
  when they confirmed it was the first in a trilogy of game's I freaked out. Can't wait for the sequel! </P>

<br>

<p>I try to learn new hobbies and new skills as often as I can to expand my knowledge ands my range of abilities. 
  I will continue to read sci-fi but also step into new genres and pick up as many skills as I can throughout my life.
